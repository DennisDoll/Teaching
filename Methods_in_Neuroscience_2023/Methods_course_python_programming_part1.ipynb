A good example for when you usually use lists is when you simply want to iterate over a certain batch of elements and don't need to access specific elements out of the list, like we did above. On the other hand, dictionaries are usually more usefull if you would like to store certain things which you want to retrieve independently of each other & really specifically, i.e. without iterating over all elements of the entire dictionary. This is of course also possible with a list, but would require you to remember the corresponding numerical index of each element.
